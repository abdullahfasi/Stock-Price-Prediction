# Stock-Price-Prediction — Deep Learning

Forecast stock prices using advanced deep learning techniques and feature-driven insights.

## Overview
This project explores LSTM-based models enhanced with embedding strategies and comparative analysis to predict stock market trends. It includes multiple scripts, visual assets, and a model improvement guide to help refine predictive performance.


## Features
- **Diverse Model Variants**: Base and improved LSTM, embedding-based, and combined architectures.
- **Analytical Comparisons**: Side-by-side performance evaluation of models.
- **Feature Insights**: Rank and visualize features that drive predictive results.
- **Visual Analytics**: Illustrated through charts like combined model graphs and feature importance visuals.
- **Guidance Documentation**: Strategic improvement recommendations in `Model_Improvement_Guide.md`.
